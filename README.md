# Sample-Codes

Two_Fluid_relativistic.py is a code wirtten in Python that solves the TOV equations for a Two-Fluid model with a relativistic EoS for the DM. The way that works is by inserting a specific dm particle mass (m_x) and a specific interaction of DM particles (z) and two specific central pressures for DM and OM (Ordinary Matter). Also, specifying a fraction (f) for the DM pressure in terms of total pressure (when you want to derive the M-R diagram) helps you to have a relation between p_b and p_x (baryonic and dm pressure) in order to derive the M-R diagram because you need the two central pressures for each fluid.

Not only that, but I have also included the derivation of the M-R diagram for the NS-DM admixed configurations. It also includes the solution of TOV for an ordinary NS and a Dark Star and the plotting of the resulted M-R diagrams.
